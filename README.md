# Data Science Salary Project

Medium Article Post: 

In summary, the project is about:
- Scraping real-world data from the Glassdoor with Selenium
- Performing data cleaning & feature engineering with NLTK
- Demonstrating EDA results with word cloud map & pivot tables 
- Machine learning model on job salary interval prediction utilizing Sklearn FeatureUnion, Random Forest Classifier (82% accuracy within an interval of 50K) 

Data Source (in total):
- Glassdoor web scraped by myself
- Ken Jee's github: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj
- Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor
